        <h4>Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played by two teams of eleven players on a large, grassy field, with a focus on batting, bowling, and fielding to score runs and get opponents out. Originating in England, the game is now played worldwide, especially in countries like India, Australia, and South Africa. The game involves a central rectangular pitch with wooden wickets at each end. Players try to hit a bowled ball to score runs by running between the wickets, while the fielding team attempts to dismiss the batsmen. Matches can range from a few hours to several days in length, with different formats including Test matches and faster-paced limited-oversÂ games.</h4>
